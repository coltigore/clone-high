# Clone High: The Text Adventure
Basically an attempt to make a Clone High text adventure to teach myself python. It's meant to be a text advendture, and I'm not sure how to make it executable outside of running the main.py file
I took the original framwork from this website, and am slowly buiilding it to be my own
