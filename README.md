# Clone High: The Text Adventure
Basically an attempt to make a Clone High text adventure to teach myself python. It's meant to be a text adventure, and I'm not sure how to make it executable outside of running the main.py file
I took the original framwork from this website, and am slowly buiilding it to be my own

# Project Goals
Create the game and allow the player to interact with various characters such as JFK, Abe, Cleo, Joan and Ghandi.

Vreate a GUI that is able to be installed on at least Windows and Linux, eliminating the need to open a terminal and tye out "python main.py"

Clone High is a property of its respective rights holders. They have not authroized this game and took no part in its creation. This is a fan Project
